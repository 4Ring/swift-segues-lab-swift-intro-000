> Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it. ~[Oprah Winfrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey)

## Learning Objectives

	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty

* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows how to work with optionals
* Classes

* Properties

## Outline / Notes

* These last few readings might be tough. I think the tougher lab can be introduced at the end of this unit. 
* This lab (unless you have a better idea) what I'm thinking is.. asking them to display in a tableview a list of words that represent certain animals. Maybe we give them this list of animals.
* Then when they segue over to another `UIViewController`, they need to display the word as well as the emoji associated with that word.
* This lab should include an xcode project empty, as well as a separate branch named solution which includes a solution to whats being asked.
* this lab should also be tested similar to this lab. This means that the student should be required to name things to HOW we want them to be named (including adding accessibility labels to view objects to get them to work.
